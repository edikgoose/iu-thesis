    The number of users of web services is increasing annually and, therefore, developers aim to develop a high reliable software.
    However, no system can withstand an arbitrary load, so site reliability engineers prepare for potential service failures by implementing various reliability practices to minimize associated risks.
    Feedback control system is a system that can give feedback about its current status so that engineers or other system components can react to it in advance the risks of a fall.
    However, for feedback control systems developers face a problem that each reliability practice is configured in its own way and combinations of these settings can give different results in the reliability of the system.
    In this work, I outline a web-service for reproducible load testing, visualization, and configuration of feedback control systems.
    The web-services were developed by using Kotlin and Spring Boot framework, and Consul was used for distributed configuration.
    Yandex Tank was chosen as a high load generator to use several cores for load generation and a convenient API.
    Additionally, by using Vaadin framework I developed a UI interface for a more convenient and visual use of the service.
    The proposed service can handle services for configuration, executed load testing scenarios and provided real-time results as graphs.
    This service can be used in testing systems under various load scenarios with different configuration variants.
    These practices help to find the most effective combination of parameters that ensures optimal system performance.
