So, why does conventional wisdom insist that software engineers focus primarily on the design and development of large-scale computing systems?In this collection of essays and articles, key members of Google{\^a}??s Site Reliability Team explain how and why their commitment to the entire lifecycle has enabled the company to successfully build, deploy, monitor, and maintain some of the largest software systems in the world.

    abstract = {Context: DevOps, the combination of Development and Operations, is a new way of thinking in the software engineering domain that recently received much attention. Given that DevOps is a new term and novel concept recently introduced, no common understanding of what it entails has been achieved yet. Consequently, definitions of DevOps often only represent a part that is relevant to the concept.Objective:This study aims to characterize DevOps by exploring central components of DevOps definitions reported in the literature, specifying practices explicitly proposed for DevOps and investigating the similarities and differences between DevOps and other existing methods in software engineering.Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted that used six electronic databases: IEEE, ACM, Inspec, Scopus, Wiley Online Library and Web of Science.Result: 44 studies have been selected that report a definition of DevOps, 15 studies explicitly stating DevOps practices, and 15 studies stating how DevOps is related to other existing methods. Papers in some cases stated a combination of a definition, practices, and relations to other methods, the total number of primary studies was 49.Conclusion: We proposed a definition for DevOps which may overcome inconsistencies over the various existing definitions of individual research studies. In addition, the practices explicitly proposed for DevOps have been presented as well as the relation to other software development methods.},

Formal database semantics has concentrated on dependency constraints, such as functional and multivalued dependencies, and on normal forms for relations. Unfortunately, much of this work has been inaccessible to researchers outside this field, due to the unfamiliar formalism in which the work is couched. In addition, the lack of a single set of definitions has confused the relationships among certain results. This paper is intended to serve the two-fold purpose of introducing the main issues and theorems of formal database semantics to the uninitiated, and to clarify the terminology of the field.},

@article{circuit_breaker,

A circuit breaker is a solution to handle failure in microservices and is now widely implemented both as a library and as a pattern embedded in the service and client modules. Despite the widespread use of circuit breaker, the research on circuit breaker is relatively less than research subject on other microservices area, or in microservices resiliency. This article provides an overview of recent research in circuit breaker, map the research subject, and find the opportunities for future research. The research is conducted using a systematic map study but the results focused on extract the knowledge and find important keywords to build a conceptual overview of the research field circuit breaker. The result shows that there are five categories of research subjects which are concept, strategy, management, implementation, and products. After exploring each category, we can propose the opportunity in enhancing the use of circuit breaker in microservices architecture, by explore the potential implementation of proxy circuit breaker.},
